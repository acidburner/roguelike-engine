This is a half baked educational attempt at writing a rogue clone / engine in JS from scratch. Use [ROT.js](https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/) instead. Or better yet, use [Rust](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/)

## Usage
- `docker-compose up`
- navigate to `localhost:8080`

## Todos
- wall collision
- entity collision
- room overlaps
- room hallways
- procedural room generation
